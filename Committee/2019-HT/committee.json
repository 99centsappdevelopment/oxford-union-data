With a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823, the Union is a student Society like no other - in the words of former Prime Minister and Union Officer Harold Macmillan, it is “the last bastion of free speech in the Western World.\"  \n\nThe Committee is currently busy arranging events for Hilary term, and we look forward to an interesting and varied term, in which we hope there will be something for all our members. In the meantime, we wish you a relaxing and refreshing vacation. If you have any questions about this term or suggestions for future terms, please do get in touch with us at enquiries@oxford-union.org."
