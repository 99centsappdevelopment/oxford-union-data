With a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823, the Union is a student Society like no other - in the words of former Prime Minister and Union Officer Harold Macmillan, it is â€œthe last bastion of free speech in the Western World.\"  \n\nOur termcard has now been released, and you can view it HERE. With a line-up of speakers ranging from Heads of State to actors, and debates on everything from World War One to the limits of science, we hope there is something for all members. If you have any questions about this term or suggestions for future terms, please do get in touch with us at enquiries@oxford-union.org.",
